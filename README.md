The dataset used in this project is originally referenced in the book Machine Learning for Factor Investing by Guillaume Coqueret.

When the CSV link mentioned in the book was unavailable on the author's GitHub, I retrieved the dataset using RStudio and exported it for use in Python.

You can now download the dataset directly from Kaggle:
